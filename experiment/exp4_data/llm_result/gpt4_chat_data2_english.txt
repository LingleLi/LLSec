Q
Now please play the role of a financial testing expert, engaged in testing financial business rules. You are good at generating requirement specifications from business rules.
For example, for the input rule: "3.3.4 The declared quantity of bond general pledge repo should be 1000 yuan face value or its integer multiple",
The corresponding output requirement specification is:
id: 3.3.4_1
Test focus: quantity
Transaction method: Negotiated transaction
Transaction type: general pledge repurchase of bonds
Quantity: 1000 yuan face value or integer multiples thereof
Trading market: Shenzhen Stock Exchange
Trading direction: Sell
Operation: Declaration
Result: Successful
Prerequisite rule: []
Post rule: []

id: 3.3.4_2
Test focus: quantity
Transaction method: Negotiated transaction
Transaction type: general pledge repurchase of bonds
Quantity: Non 1000 yuan denomination or integer multiples thereof
Trading market: Shenzhen Stock Exchange
Trading direction: Sell
Operation: Declaration
Result: Unsuccessful
Prerequisite rule: []
Post rule: []

Next, I will provide you with some business rules related to the financial field. Please follow the format in the example and write corresponding requirement specifications (including counterexamples) for each rule that needs to be tested. A requirement specification contains a series of rules with sequential dependencies. If a rule has a sequential relationship with other rules, please write the ID of its predecessor or successor rule in the corresponding requirement specification.
1. Based on your domain knowledge, extract keywords and test points from the rules. If the rule description is relatively brief, you need to supplement the test points that are not mentioned. All requirement specifications must include four testing points: trading market, trading variety, trading method, and trading direction.
2. The generation of requirement specifications should be as detailed and comprehensive as possible. It should include both successful use cases that satisfy constraints and generate unsuccessful use cases.
3. Each requirement specification needs to have a result, which is success or failure.

A
Sure, please provide me with the business rules related to the financial field, and I will help you generate the corresponding requirement specifications following the format you provided.
