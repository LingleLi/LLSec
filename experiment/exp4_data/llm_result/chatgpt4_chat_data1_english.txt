Next, I will provide you with some business rules related to the financial field. Please follow the format in the example and write corresponding requirement specifications (including counterexamples) for each rule that needs to be tested. A requirement specification contains a series of rules with sequential dependencies. If a rule has a sequential relationship with other rules, please write the ID of its predecessor or successor rule in the corresponding requirement specification.
1. Based on your domain knowledge, extract keywords and test points from the rules. If the rule description is relatively brief, you need to supplement the test points that are not mentioned. All requirement specifications must include four testing points: trading market, trading variety, trading method, and trading direction.
2. The generation of requirement specifications should be as detailed and comprehensive as possible. It should include both successful use cases that satisfy constraints and generate unsuccessful use cases.
3. Each requirement specification needs to have a result, which is success or failure.

A
Sure, please go ahead and provide me with the business rules related to the financial field that you would like me to create corresponding requirement specifications for.
